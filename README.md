## Why I Chose Cypress Instead of Puppeteer

Purpose-Built for Testing

Cypress is designed specifically for end-to-end testing, with built-in support for assertions, test runner, and time-travel debugging.

Puppeteer is a general-purpose browser automation library (great for web scraping or simple scripting), not testing-specific.

Better Developer Experience

Cypress provides an interactive Test Runner that shows each test step and its result in real time with a snapshot of the app state.

Easier debugging thanks to time-travel and built-in stack traces.

Built-in Assertions & Wait Handling

Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear or load‚Äîno need for manual wait() or retry logic.

Puppeteer requires more manual handling for waits, increasing test flakiness.

Faster Setup for Web UI Testing

Cypress comes preloaded with testing tools (Mocha, Chai, etc.), while Puppeteer would require extra setup and integration.
